# Intro To Constructors

I have set up a couple directories, `src` and `test`, and a few files.
Your task is to fill out the file(s) under `src` so that the tests will
pass.

First, you'll need to install the dependencies, so run

    npm install

If you get errors during that step, try prepending the command with `sudo`.

Then you can run the tests with

    npm test

The tests will fail initially. Try to find out why. Look at
`test/automobile_test.js` and try to understand what it's
testing. Modify `src/automobile.js` to get the tests to pass.
Keep running the tests and modifying automobile.js until you
get it.
