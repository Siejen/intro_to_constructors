# Intro To Constructors

I have set up a couple directories, `src` and `test`, and a few files.
Your task is to fill out the files under `src` so that the tests will
pass.

First, you'll need to install the dependencies, so run

    npm install

If you get errors during that step, try prepending the command with `sudo`.

Then you can run the tests with

    npm test
